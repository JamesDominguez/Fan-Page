<p>Family Guy is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company.</p>
<p>The series centers on the Griffins, a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children, Meg, </p>
<p> Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog, Brian. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, </p>
<p> and exhibits much of its humor in the form of metafictional cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.</p>
